grunt-dojowidget-init-task
==========================

[*NOTE*: This project has been superceded by the [generator-dojo-class](https://github.com/stdavis/generator-dojo-class) yeoman generator.]

A [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) init template for creating a new dojo widget and associated [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) test suite.

To install put the `tasks` folder in `~/.grunt-init/`.

To use run `grunt-init:dojowidget`.

I would love someone to make this into a grunt plugin. I've tried but couldn't make it work.
